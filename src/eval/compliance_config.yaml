# Configuration for FP8 Compliance Checks
# This file lists the attributes that the LayerComparator should check for quantization compliance.

# List of attributes to check for quantization compliance
# These are attributes on the layer module (e.g. module.last_quant_rm)
quantized_params:
  - last_quant_rm   # BatchNorm running mean
  - last_quant_rv   # BatchNorm running variance
  - bias_quant      # Quantized bias (if stored separately)
  - weight_fp8      # Explicit FP8 weights
  - weight          # Standard weights (fallback)

# Future extensibility: Input/Output capture names
# input_capture:
#   - last_quant_input_unscaled
